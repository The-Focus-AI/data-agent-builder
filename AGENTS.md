# Architecture

- always use pnpm and typescript
- always run things with tsx and not have a seperaete build
- prefer to use node --test over external frameworks
- always use the latest version of the library

# Planning

- if you don't have a agreed upon plan, prompt me to create a prd for the feature
- always lookup the documentation first in the docs folder, then the demo/ folder, and then context7 or a web search
- update the PRD as you are going
- store your documentation in the docs/ folder and use that to resuse and update your learnings on librarys

# Context

- Always keep a docs/active-context.md file that represents the current working stage of the project.
- when we complete a new phase, put all of your thinking into active context replaceing everything except "pending items"
- when you complete a phase, update the docs/proejct-log.md and the prd with the current state of things and clean out active-context.md with anything not strictly relavent
