Complete Excel to Database Import Workflow

Please perform the complete Excel file analysis and database import workflow:

1. First, get the list of sheets in the Excel file
2. Examine the raw data from each sheet (first 20 rows) to understand the structure
3. Analyze the data and determine the best parser configuration (header row, data start row, etc.)
4. Get the parsed headers and propose meaningful SQL column names that preserve the original meaning while being SQL-compatible
5. Decide on appropriate SQL data types for each column (TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, DATE, DATETIME)
6. Choose the best import strategy (single_table for similar sheets, separate_tables for different sheets)
7. Write the configuration files (parser config and table metadata)
8. Create the SQLite table with your proposed meaningful column names
9. Import all the data from the Excel file into the database

For column names, follow these guidelines:
- Use lowercase with underscores (e.g., "Overall Rank" → "overall_rank")
- Preserve the original meaning (e.g., "Brand Name" → "brand_name")
- Avoid SQL reserved words (select, from, where, order, group, etc.)
- Keep names descriptive and readable
- Examples: "Total Followers" → "total_followers", "From: 2025-08-01" → "date_from"

Provide clear feedback about your analysis, decisions, and the import results. Make sure to show the column mappings so I can see how the original Excel headers were transformed into SQL column names.
