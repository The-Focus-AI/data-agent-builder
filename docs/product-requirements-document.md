# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Data Agent Builder

### Executive Summary

The Data Agent Builder is a tool that analyzes data files (Excel/CSV), understands their structure and domain context through interactive chat, and generates intelligent TypeScript tools and chat agents using the Umwelten framework. The core value proposition is creating domain-specific, intelligent tools that understand the business context of data, not just generic CRUD operations.

### Problem Statement

Currently, working with new data files requires:
- Manual analysis of file structure and column meanings
- Writing custom code for each new data source
- No intelligent understanding of what queries would be valuable
- Repetitive work for similar data types across different files

### Solution Overview

A meta-agent that:
1. **Analyzes** data files to understand structure and patterns
2. **Collaborates** with users to understand business context and requirements
3. **Generates** intelligent, domain-specific tools and complete chat agents
4. **Outputs** production-ready TypeScript projects with comprehensive testing

### Core Features

#### 1. File Analysis Engine
- **Input**: Excel (.xlsx/.xls) and CSV files
- **Analysis**: 
  - Column structure and data types
  - Data patterns and relationships
  - Potential business context from column names
  - Statistical summaries and distributions
- **Output**: Structured metadata about the file

#### 2. Interactive Analysis Agent
- **Hybrid Interaction Model**:
  - Agent provides initial analysis and insights
  - User collaborates to define business context
  - Together determine valuable queries and tools
- **Intelligent Suggestions**:
  - Suggests domain-specific tools based on data patterns
  - Recommends useful queries and filters
  - Identifies potential business use cases

#### 3. Smart Tool Generation
- **Core Value**: Domain-specific intelligent tools
  - Examples: `getTalentFollowers()`, `analyzeGrowthTrends()`, `comparePlatforms()`
  - Context-aware function names and parameters
  - Business-logic-aware filtering and aggregation
- **Safety Net**: Basic CRUD operations always included
  - `getData()`, `filterBy()`, `sortBy()`, `count()`
  - Ensures generated tools always work

#### 4. Complete Project Generation
- **Output Structure**:
  ```
  generated-agent/
  ├── src/
  │   ├── tools/           # Generated domain-specific tools
  │   ├── agent.ts         # Main chat agent
  │   └── types.ts         # TypeScript types
  ├── test/                # Test files with sample data
  ├── package.json         # Dependencies and scripts
  ├── README.md           # Usage documentation
  └── sample-data/        # Test data files
  ```
- **Ready to Run**: `npm install && npm test && tsx src/agent.ts`

#### 5. Native Node.js Testing
- **Test Framework**: Node.js 18+ built-in test runner
- **Test Coverage**:
  - Unit tests for each generated tool
  - Integration tests with sample data
  - Validation tests for edge cases
- **Sample Data**: Automatically generated test data based on original file structure

### User Workflow

#### Phase 1: File Analysis
1. User provides data file (Excel/CSV)
2. System analyzes file structure, types, and patterns
3. Agent presents initial findings and insights

#### Phase 2: Collaborative Understanding
1. Agent asks clarifying questions about business context
2. User explains what columns mean and what queries would be valuable
3. Together they explore potential use cases and tools

#### Phase 3: Tool Generation
1. Agent suggests domain-specific tools based on analysis
2. User selects which tools to include
3. System generates intelligent, context-aware tool functions

#### Phase 4: Project Output
1. System generates complete TypeScript project
2. Includes all selected tools, tests, and documentation
3. User can immediately run and test the generated agent

### Technical Requirements

#### Architecture
